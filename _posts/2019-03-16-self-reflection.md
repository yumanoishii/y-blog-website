# Self Reflection

Let's get personal!

The past couple of years, I've been through a lot of trauma and personal challenges. Coming out from the ashes from burned bridges, self-destruction and disillusionment, I feel like a phoenix, reborn from the past, better, stronger and most importantly, able to move forward.&nbsp;

One of the most important lessons I learned – and still learning – is standing up for myself. I loathed the idea of self-care because I saw it as white feminist bullshit and frankly, shallow.&nbsp;

But over the years, I learned it the hard way that self love – and true self-love, not narcissism – is so, so important, especially for someone who lives through the world as a woman. With that comes self-growth, which is something I think all human beings must go through.&nbsp;

And for me, it was about being aware of myself, and how I work, both internally and externally. Which was how I got into MBTI anyway. And Enneagram, and all of these other personality and psychology studies. Besides the intellectual aspect of all of this, I also find actually being AWARE, the idea of staying present and noticing what's happening around me and inside me, to be integral to my self-growth.&nbsp;

Because of how I learned to **feel&nbsp;****for the sake of others**, rather than for myself, to some extent I lost my capacity to see and take ownership for my own feelings in an authentic way. Often I am confused about my own feelings because I didn't learn how to develop my own feelings growing up. So I'm like: do I want to or do I want to because others want to?&nbsp;

First, it was realizing that this loss of personal feeling was happening and that it's an issue. That was half the battle.&nbsp;

For years, I tried to develop my awareness of how I feel. What was the most useful was **connecting feelings with physiological sensations** such as tightening of the heart, prickly sensations and numbness. They all correlated with certain feelings, and I learned to notice them and take mental notes.&nbsp;

These immediate notes helped me tremendously in processing my emotions. Instead of pushing away my feelings to accommodate others, I learned to at least acknowledge my own needs.&nbsp;

And what a liberating feeling! Even though it's extremely uncomfortable to face my own feelings authentically, I felt that I was actually letting them go instead of letting them build up inside of me.&nbsp;

This slow process then opened doors for further self-development. Once I started to understand my own feelings and needs, I finally took steps to take care of them. How would one take care of something they are unaware of, right?

Taking care of my physical needs was easy, as I've been living on my own for a while. Taking care of my mental and emotional needs was another story. Recognizing these needs is a start, but it's not the end. For someone like me who has been drilled to think for others, having my own needs means a lot of internal struggles between balancing my own needs and those of others.&nbsp;

I found myself still giving up many of my own needs for the sake of others, even though I knew and was aware of what I wanted.&nbsp;

This was still an issue, as it led to building up a lot of resentment and tension against other people. I felt taken advantage of, I felt uncared for, I felt **empty**.&nbsp;

And now I look back with some sense of humor because it feels silly that I thought those thoughts. Of course I felt that way, because I didn't take care of myself and my needs. I didn't need to sacrifice for others. It was something that I built my self-worth on. And that was dangerous.&nbsp;

So many people like me who are people-pleasers and care-takers, tend to take on this supposedly virtuous and noble role of the "martyr". Society reinforces this too, especially for women. But when you actually understand this dynamic, you begin to realize that it's toxic and unhealthy.&nbsp;

It's a two-pronged issue. One, it makes the "martyr" build their self-worth upon pleasing others and taking care of others. But what happens when no one needs them, or they perceive that no one needs them? Their self-worth collapses.&nbsp;

Two, everyone has needs, and when they are suppressed to an extreme extent, what happens to this person? It's a sense of disillusionment and loss of self.

Of course, I'm not saying that sacrificing yourself for others is a BAD thing. It's just when it's done to an extent where one loses oneself and is dependent upon others for self-worth, it becomes a major issue.&nbsp;

So the solution is to build oneself. And I mean authentically too. I remember finally realizing that I was losing myself to others, and the sense of worthlessness and depression that I entered. It was a dark period of my life, to say the least.&nbsp;

But I learned to pull myself out of the situation and focused on resolving such a personal crisis. I wanted to move forward. And this time, not for anyone else but myself.&nbsp;

I started recognizing how resilient I am. And the many great qualities that I have that I have neglected to shine light upon. During the hardest times, I was the one who was there, and no one else. I was my best friend, parent, sibling, all in one.&nbsp;

This profound recognition of self-worth gave me hope.&nbsp;

Now I'm working on myself, both internally in therapy and externally in activities and interests to pursue. I'm building better relationships with people and less judgmental. I'm happy about where I am, and where I'm heading, despite many challenges and hardships right now.&nbsp;

Most important of all, I'm glad I'm finding myself and seeing my worth. I'm learning to truly love myself for all the weirdo, quirky, fun, shy, kind, generous, cold, sad, mean, grumpy, rigid, soft parts of myself. Because I am me, and I always will be me.&nbsp;
