When most folks first encounter MBTI, it's not cognitive functions that they interact with. It's more the "letters": S or N, I or E, etc.

While the letters can provide us with some perspectives about each type, MBTI is, afterall, a watered-down version of the original Jungian theories about the types.&nbsp;

In Jung's original writings, he frequently uses cognitive functions as a framework to explain the types, mainly separating the introverted ones from the extroverted ones. Then he explains all of the functions accordingly.&nbsp;

Because I'm an INFJ, I've studied my own functions most extensively. Even after months of reading articles and digesting them, I still have many questions about them. But that's what makes them so fascinating to me.&nbsp;

OK, enough rambling, let's get to the actual functions:

INFJs have the function stack of the following:

1. Introverted Intuition, or Ni
2. Extroverted Feeling, or Fe
3. Introverted Thinking, or Ti
4. Extroverted Sensing, or Se

Even though the "stacking order" concept is debatable, given that it prioritizes some functions over others. But I find the functions themselves useful and interesting.&nbsp;

Let's begin with Ni, the most complex function of these 4:

Ni is, as described, intuition at its core. But what does introverted intuition mean? What does intuition itself even mean?&nbsp;

It's a tricky function because it's an unconscious process to begin with. Imagine describing something that you aren't aware of. Regardless, let's discuss what intuition is first:

Intuition is a shortcut. It collects information through all modes, including the senses, personal experiences, outside information, etc. Then it forms conclusions about the future. It is visionary and speculative. It is first and foremost a perceiving function because it does not make judgments but rather form impressions. Eventually these impressions come to the consciousness, but without the details of HOW it arrived at these impressions.&nbsp;

It is useful and often seen as "magical" because it is quick and requires seemingly little effort. However, it is a form of background processing that requires a certain detachment from physical senses. We will get to the downside of this characteristic later.&nbsp;

OK, so in short, intuition is an unconscious processing that shoots out impressional conclusions about the future quickly.&nbsp;

What about introverted intuition then?

To be honest, I find intuition, especially dominant intuitions, to be understood easiest in relation to each other. Introverted and Extroverted intuition mesh well with each other. They have some essential traits in common, as mentioned above.&nbsp;

Introverted Intuition is subjective and based on the individual's interpretations and impressions. It is also often linear, singular and most importantly, implosive. What I mean by implosive is that it collects information from all sources to form a single or narrow conclusion. It gravitates toward closure, elegance and comprehensiveness. It wants a full picture. It craves depth.&nbsp;

Extroverted Intuition, on the other hand, is objective and based on the external world. The process is chaotic, dynamic and -- contrasting with introverted intuitives -- explosive. It takes one singular stimulus, and brainstorms many new ideas, often entirely new connections from the norm. It enjoys openness, variety and options. It wants many pieces from many places. It desires breadth.&nbsp;

I know what you are thinking, these two sides of the intuition coin sound nothing alike. If anything, they are opposites.&nbsp;
