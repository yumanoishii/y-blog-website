Wanted to ramble about the INFJ experience for now. Since this site is launched on short notice, I want to just dump my ideas/feelings/thinkings via posts for now. I hope to create a page just for psychology things eventually.&nbsp;

Right now I'm feeling a lot of things as an INFJ experiencing some growth pain. I've been through a lot in the past couple of years, both personally and professionally. I'm just really tired and trying to heal and get back to where I was before all the mess.&nbsp;

As an INFJ, I often feel profound loneliness. And it's not being around people or having connections. It's a sense of existential loneliness. I sometimes feel that my existence is painful because there's something fundamentally lacking. I feel that I want to be part of something, a sense of belonging, maybe, but what exactly that is, I'm not sure of.&nbsp;

And in this state of the world where a lot of things are falling apart, I'm feeling hopeless at times. It's a lot of negative and frightening energy I'm absorbing from around me that makes me very exhausted.&nbsp;

I want to look forward though and not get stuck thinking of the worst even in this mess of a world. I think INFJs have a lot of potential in changing this world with others because we are idealists and visionaries. In a historical moment where things are moving toward new directions, I think us, and other intuitives, can have a lot of contributions to building a new world.&nbsp;

In any case, that's my rambles for now. See you next time!
